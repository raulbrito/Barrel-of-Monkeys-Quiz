Barrel of Monkeys
=================

Partial Java implementation of Ruby quizz number 30: Barrel Of Monkeys.

The current implementation is very naive, but it aims at showing
some main concepts of Java Programming: interfaces, testing, mocking,etc..

Unfortunately I have no time at the moment to do a more fancy
implementation which would require graph-type data structures
and smarter searching algorithms.


Description of the problem:

Last week one of the local radio stations was having a “Barrel of Mon-
keys” afternoon. While a song was playing, listeners would call in and
suggest the next song, which had to begin with the same letter as the
playing song ended in.
So, for example, a sample (eclectic) Barrel of Monkeys playlist might be
as follows:
  1. “Peace Train”
  2. “No More ‘I Love You’s”’
  3. “Super Trooper”
  4. “Rock Me, Amadeus”
  5. “Song of the South”
  6. “Hooked on a Feeling”
  7. “Go Tell It on the Mountain”
See how each song name begins with the last letter of the name of the
song before it?
Just creating any playlist would be too easy, however. We need a worthy
problem to solve:
  1. Given any starting and ending song, create a playlist that connects
      the two songs.
  2. For extra credit, try to create a playlist of a specific duration (to fill
      a particular time slot on the radio).
  3. For more extra credit, try to find the shortest playlist that links
      the songs (either in terms of number of songs or total play time).

You can find an XML file with more than 5,000 song names and play
times at http://rubyquiz.com/SongLibrary.xml.gz (100KB compressed). The
song durations are in milliseconds.
Finally, because this problem may be enough fun without having to
discover trouble yourself, I offer a few things to think about here:
   • What do you do with songs with names like “’74-’75” or “Seventy
     Times 7” or “=:0 :(”?
   • How about a song named “Candy Everybody Wants (unplugged)”
     or “Voulez-Vous [Extended Remix, 1979 US Promo]” or “Speed
     Racer - Hardcore Mix” or “Breathe Remix Feat Sean Paul”?
   • What do you do if there is no way to connect two songs? (And how
     do you know for sure?)
